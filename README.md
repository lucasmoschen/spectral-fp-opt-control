# Fokker-Planck equation 

The Fokker-Planck equation is a very important Partial Differential equations with is strongly related to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE). 
In particular, it is the distribution of a random process described by a SDE with a drift and a diffusion coefficient.
This repository cointains information about my studies at Imperial College London during the Autumn term of 2022.
